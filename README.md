Pandora – Own the box, own the chaos

**Pandora** is a lightweight, extensible floating dev panel that sticks to the bottom of your screen and gives you quick access to the tools you wish your framework shipped with.

Built with [Lit](https://lit.dev/), Pandora is incredibly easy to extend—even with minimal developer experience. Add links, utilities, launchers, notes, music controls, and more. If it helps you build faster, it belongs in Pandora.

## 🧠 Why Pandora?

Framework dev bars are great—until you want to customize them. Astro and Next.js give you a dev bar but keep it locked.

> We wanted to open the box.

So we built **Pandora**—an open, extendable dev toolbelt that *you* control.

## 🔧 Features
- 🧰 Floating panel that’s always within reach
- 🧱 Built with Lit Web Components – extend with ease
- 🧩 Add launchers, sticky notes, music, shortcuts & more
- ✨ Bring your own tools or use our premade ones
- 🎯 Works with any stack – not just frameworks with built-in dev bars
- 🔓 Fully customizable with minimal setup

## 🚀 Get Started
1. Add the Pandora component to your dev environment.
2. Customize or extend it with your own tools.
3. Build faster, think less.

Made with ❤️ by devs who wanted more from their dev bars.
